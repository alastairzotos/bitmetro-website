    Hi, I'm Alastair, the founder of bitmetro.
    
    I have been developing software since I was 10 years old making games in my bedroom. Since then my interests have grown and I currently work as a full stack software engineer primarily using React and Node.js, with active involvement in DevOps/Infra/CICD. I also build programming languages, virtual assistants, browser plugins, and other curiosities.
